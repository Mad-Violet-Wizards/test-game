## 1. How to create a new branch:

In our project we've some subdirectories that **names** are specified as a name of library/project, for now, we handle plenty of them.

If you want to create a new branch, use one of those names:

* **game** - if you're creating a new feature/fix in "Game/" folder,
* **framework** - if you're creating a new feature/fix in "Framework/" folder,
* **app** - if you're creating a new feature/fix in "App/" folder,
* **gui** - if you're creating a new feature/fix in "GUI/" folder,
* **lib** - if you're adding new library/refactoring code one of them,
* **assets** - if you have modifed something in "Assets/" folder,
* **scripts** - if you're adding a new script, f.e. for compilation,
* **project** - if you're doing something general in project,
* **docs** - if you're doing something related to docs/ folder.

Second part is some description of thing, you're doing, f.e **adding-new-player-animation**,

In this case, full name of branch would be: **game/adding-new-player-animation**.

## 2. How to merge:

If you completed your task, push you changes to your branch and create a new pull request. Describe your changes and assign one of developers to review your changes and wait for code review. ðŸ˜„
